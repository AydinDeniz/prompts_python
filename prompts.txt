"Write a Python script to load a CSV file, handle missing values (impute with median for numerical and mode for categorical), remove duplicates, normalize numerical columns between 0 and 1, and convert categorical columns to one-hot encoding."
"Create a Python script using BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape a website's product information, including names, prices, ratings, and URLs, then save it to a CSV file. If available, handle pagination to collect data from multiple pages."
"Write a Python script using scikit-learn to load a dataset, split it into train-test sets, scale features, train a Random Forest classifier, and evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Plot the ROC curve and feature importance."
"Create a Python REST API using Flask/FastAPI that allows CRUD operations, handles user authentication, rate limits, and logs all requests, responses, and errors to a database."
"Write a Python script using SQLite to create a database for a library system with tables for books, authors, and members. Include relationships, populate with sample data, and query it to display all books by a specific author."
"Create a Python script to monitor a folder for new files every 5 minutes, rename each new file with a timestamp, move it to a different directory, and log all operations to a text file."
"Generate a Python script using Matplotlib and Pandas to load a dataset, create a line plot showing trends over time, add labels, legends, and customize the plot aesthetics. Export the final plot as a PNG file."
"Build an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras to predict future stock prices based on historical data. Load the data, preprocess it for time series analysis, split it into training and testing sets, and evaluate the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Plot the predictions vs. actual prices."
"Write a Python app using Streamlit that allows users to upload a CSV file, select columns for analysis, and display summary statistics and customizable visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots) for each selected column."
"Generate a secure random key of specified length using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Use a random function to ensure each key is unique every time it is generated."
